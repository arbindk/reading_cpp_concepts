There are some important rules for overloading functions:
Return-Type is not a factor for uniqueness: Return-Type plays no role in resolving ambiguity of overloaded functions. Thus, two functions declared exactly the same with only the return-type different will generate a compilation error.

    int add(int, int);
    double add(int, int);       //generates Compilation Error


Argument Names are not a factor for uniqueness: Similar to above, declaring argument names differently with their types same also doesn't resolve ambiguity.

    int add(int a, int b);
    double add(int c, int d);//generates Compilation Error
